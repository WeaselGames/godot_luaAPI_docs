# Installation

## Compiling from source

### Getting the sources
- Start by cloning the main branch of the Godot engine  
`git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot`
- Next cd into godot/modules and clone this repo  
`cd godot/modules`  
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WeaselGames/godot_luaAPI luaAPI`

### Compiling
This module does not requires any extra tooling to compile besides that required by Godot its self. So from this point you can follow the tutorial on the [Godot wiki](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/index.html).
