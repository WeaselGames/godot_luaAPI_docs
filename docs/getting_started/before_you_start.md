# Before you start...

## What this module isn't for
Before you start using this module, you should know that this module does not provide a replacement for GDScript.

If that is what you are looking for I suggest you check out one of these modules:  

- [luascript](https://github.com/perbone/luascript) by [perbone](https://github.com/perbone)  
- [godot-lua-pluginscript](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-lua-pluginscript) by [gilzoide](https://github.com/gilzoide)  

## What this module is for

This is a Godot engine module that adds Lua API support via GDScript.
This module provides no functionality to program your game out of the box. This module allows you to create custom modding API's in a sandboxed environment. You have control of what people can and can not do within that sandbox.
